          graduate of the Federal university of technology,Owerri, and i studied
          Polymer and textile engineering.In my free time i watch football
          matches and listen to music. I love going on X to read tweets. I have
          interest in politics and i have held several leadership positions. I
          love to appear on immaculate white or black clothes,i would think of
          myself as a fashinable person, so don't be surprised to see me pull an
          Ebuka of

        <h2>Why AltschoolAfrica?</h2>
        <p>
          I love to push myself at all times which is why i am taking this
          course. My quest for global relevance to fascilitate my 'japa' journey
          instigated this course. I had wanted to move abroad but i needed
          substance and relevance and not just leaving empty.I have sacrificed
          alot to be here because i currently do business and its not easy
          combining the two.

        <h2>My goals</h2>
        <p>
          I enrolled in AltschoolAfrica because of its pedigree because after
          much consultations, it was highly recommended. My dream to become a
          worldie in tech court only be seduced by a great techschool as
          AltschoolAfrica. My dream is to become very good in tech and appeal to
          institutions internationallty. I want to hone a great skill in tech to
          be self dependent in a world that is evolving completely into
          technology and i never want to be left behind. I want to be greatly
          relevant and well positioned in global advancement.
